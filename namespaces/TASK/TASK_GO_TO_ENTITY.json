It could work differently on other entities, didn't try it yet.\n\nExample: TASK::TASK_GO_TO_ENTITY(pedHandle, vehicleHandle, 5000, 4.0, 100, 1073741824, 0)\n\nPed will run towards the vehicle for 5 seconds and stop when time is over or when he gets 4 meters(?) around the vehicle (with duration = -1, the task duration will be ignored).\n\nenum EGOTO_ENTITY_SCRIPT_FLAGS\n{\n\tEGOTO_ENTITY_NEVER_SLOW_FOR_PATH_LENGTH = 0x01,\n};",
