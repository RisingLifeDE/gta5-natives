        "comment": "rotationOrder is the order yaw, pitch and roll is applied. Usually 2. Returns a vector where the Z coordinate is the yaw.\n\nrotationOrder refers to the order yaw pitch roll is applied; value ranges from 0 to 5 and is usually *2* in scripts.\nWhat you use for rotationOrder when getting must be the same as rotationOrder when setting the rotation.\n\nWhat it returns is the yaw on the z part of the vector, which makes sense considering R* considers z as vertical. Here's a picture for those of you who don't understand pitch, yaw, and roll: www.allstar.fiu.edu/aero/images/pic5-1.gif\n\nRotation Orders:\n0: ZYX - Rotate around the z-axis, then the y-axis and finally the x-axis.\n1: YZX - Rotate around the y-axis, then the z-axis and finally the x-axis.\n2: ZXY - Rotate around the z-axis, then the x-axis and finally the y-axis.\n3: XZY - Rotate around the x-axis, then the z-axis and finally the y-axis.\n4: YXZ - Rotate around the y-axis, then the x-axis and finally the z-axis.\n5: XYZ - Rotate around the x-axis, then the y-axis and finally the z-axis.",
