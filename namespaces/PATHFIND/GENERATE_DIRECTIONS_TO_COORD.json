This happens randomly during the drive but consistently at {2044.0358, 2996.6116, 44.9717} if you face towards the bar and the route needs you to turn right. In that particular case, it could be a bug with how the turn appears to be 270 deg. CCW instead of \"right.\" Either way, this seems to be the engine saying \"I don't know the route right now.\"\n\nreturn value set to 0 always",
