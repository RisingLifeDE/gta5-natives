Set positive for winding and negative for unwinding.\n\nRigid - If max length is zero, and this is set to false the rope will become rigid (it will force a specific distance, what ever length is, between the objects).\n\nbreakable - Whether or not shooting the rope will break it.\n\nunkPtr - unknown ptr, always 0 in orig scripts\n__\n\nLengths can be calculated like so:\n\nfloat distance = abs(x1 - x2) + abs(y1 - y2) + abs(z1 - z2); // Rope length\n\n\nNOTES:\n\nRope does NOT interact with anything you attach it to, in some cases it make interact with the world AFTER it breaks (seems to occur if you set the type to -1).\n\nRope will sometimes contract and fall to the ground like you'd expect it to, but since it doesn't interact with the world the effect is just jaring.",
