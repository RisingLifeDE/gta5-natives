So it will then return 0 - 35 or -1 if it's 'z'. The func to handle that ^^ is func_67 in dialog_handler.c atleast in TU27 Xbox360 scripts.\n\np0 is -1, 0 - 35\np1 is a char or string (whatever you wanna call it)\np2 is Global 10597 + i * 6. 'i' is a while(i < 70) loop\np3 is again -1, 0 - 35 \np4 is again -1, 0 - 35 \np5 is either 0 or 1 (bool ?)\np6 is either 0 or 1 (The func to determine this is bool)\np7 is either 0 or 1 (The func to determine this is bool)\np8 is either 0 or 1 (The func to determine this is bool)\np9 is 0 - 3 (Determined by func_60 in dialogue_handler.c)\np10 is either 0 or 1 (The func to determine this is bool)\np11 is either 0 or 1 (The func to determine this is bool)\np12 is unknown as in TU27 X360 scripts it only goes to p11.",
