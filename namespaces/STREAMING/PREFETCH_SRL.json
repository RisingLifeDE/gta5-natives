This is usually used for 'in-game' cinematics (not cutscenes but camera stuff) instead of SET_FOCUS_POS_AND_VEL because it loads a specific area of the map which is pretty useful when the camera moves from distant areas.\nFor instance, GTA:O opening cutscene.\nhttps://pastebin.com/2EeKVeLA : a list of SRL found in srllist.meta\nhttps://pastebin.com/zd9XYUWY here is the content of a SRL file opened with codewalker.",
