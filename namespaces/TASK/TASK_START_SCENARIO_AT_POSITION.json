The second like TASK_START_SCENARIO_IN_PLACE is the name of the scenario. \n\nThe next 4 parameters were harder to decipher. After viewing \"hairdo_shop_mp.ysc.c4\", and being confused from seeing the case in other scripts, they passed the first three of the arguments as one array from a function, and it looked like it was obviously x, y, and z.\n\nI haven't seen the sixth parameter go to or over 360, making me believe that it is rotation, but I really can't confirm anything.\n\nI have no idea what the last 3 parameters are, but I'll try to find out.\n\n-going on the last 3 parameters, they appear to always be \"0, 0, 1\"\n\np6 -1 also used in scrips\n\np7 used for sitting scenarios\n\np8 teleports ped to position",
