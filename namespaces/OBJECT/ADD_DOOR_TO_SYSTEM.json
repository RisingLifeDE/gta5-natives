If scriptDoor and isLocal are both false, the door is considered to be in a \"Persists w/o netobj\" state.\n\ndoor hashes normally look like PROP_[int]_DOOR_[int] for interior doors and PROP_BUILDING_[int]_DOOR_[int] exterior doors but you can just make up your own hash if you want\nAll doors need to be registered with ADD_DOOR_TO_SYSTEM before they can be manipulated with the door natives and the easiest way to get door models is just find the door in codewalker.\n\nExample: AddDoorToSystem(\"PROP_43_DOOR_0\", \"hei_v_ilev_fh_heistdoor2\", -1456.818, -520.5037, 69.67043, 0, 0, 0)",
