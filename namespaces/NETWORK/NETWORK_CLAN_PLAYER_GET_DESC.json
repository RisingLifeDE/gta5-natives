        "comment": "bufferSize is 35 in the scripts.\n\nbufferSize is the elementCount of p0(desc), sizeof(p0) == 280 == p1*8 == 35 * 8, p2(netHandle) is obtained from NETWORK::NETWORK_HANDLE_FROM_PLAYER.  And no, I can't explain why 35 * sizeof(int) == 280 and not 140, but I'll get back to you on that.\n\nthe answer is: because p0 an int64_t* / int64_t[35].  and FYI p2 is an int64_t[13]\n\nhttps://pastebin.com/cSZniHak",
