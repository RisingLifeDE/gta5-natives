The ped will try to position its vehicle there.\n-1 = behind\n0 = ahead\n1 = left\n2 = right\n3 = back left\n4 = back right\n\nif the target is closer than noRoadsDistance, the driver will ignore pathing/roads and follow you directly.\n\nDriving Styles guide: gtaforums.com/topic/822314-guide-driving-styles/",
