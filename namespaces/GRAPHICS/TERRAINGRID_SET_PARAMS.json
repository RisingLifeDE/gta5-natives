        "comment": "This native is used along with these two natives: `TERRAINGRID_ACTIVATE` and `TERRAINGRID_SET_COLOURS`.\nThis native configures the location, size, rotation, normal height, and the difference ratio between min, normal and max.\n\nAll those natives combined they will output something like this: https://i.imgur.com/TC6cku6.png\n\nThis native renders a box at the given position, with a special shader that renders a grid on world geometry behind it. This box does not have backface culling.\nThe forward args here are a direction vector, something similar to what's returned by GET_ENTITY_FORWARD_VECTOR.\nnormalHeight and heightDiff are used for positioning the color gradient of the grid, colors specified via TERRAINGRID_SET_COLOURS.\n\nExample with box superimposed on the image to demonstrate: https://i.imgur.com/wdqskxd.jpg",
