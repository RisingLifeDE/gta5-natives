Works only for oppressor _2_ and deluxo.\nFor deluxo it just immediately removes vehicle's \"wings\" and you will be not able to fly up.\nFor oppressor 2 it will remove wings right after you land. And you will not able to fly up anymore too.\nBut for opressor 2 you still can fly if you somehow get back in the air.",
