ModelHash seems to always be 0 when not a modelHash in the scripts, as stated above. \n\nThese flags were found in the b617d scripts: 0,2,4,6,7,23,127,260,2146,2175,12294,16384,16386,20503,32768,67590,67711,98309,100359.\nConverted to binary, each bit probably represents a flag as explained regarding another native here: gtaforums.com/topic/822314-guide-driving-styles\n\nConversion of found flags to binary: https://pastebin.com/kghNFkRi\n\nAt exactly 16384 which is 0100000000000000 in binary and 4000 in hexadecimal only planes are returned. \n\nIt's probably more convenient to use worldGetAllVehicles(int *arr, int arrSize) and check the shortest distance yourself and sort if you want by checking the vehicle type with for example VEHICLE::IS_THIS_MODEL_A_BOAT\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nConclusion: This native is not worth trying to use. Use something like this instead: https://pastebin.com/xiFdXa7h\n\nFull list of vehicles by DurtyFree: https://github.com/DurtyFree/gta-v-data-dumps/blob/master/vehicles.json",
