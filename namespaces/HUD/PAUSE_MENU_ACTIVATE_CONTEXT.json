Context is basically a 'condition'. \nThe `*ALL*` part of the context means that whatever is being defined, will be active when any or all of those conditions after `*ALL*` are met.\nThe `*NONE*` part of the context section means that whatever is being defined, will NOT be active if any or all of the conditions after `*NONE*` are met.\nThis basically allows you to hide certain menu sections, or things like instructional buttons.",
